# CropDiseaseDetection

### Novelty

One of the important sectors of the Indian Economy is Agriculture. Employment to almost 50% of the country’s workforce is provided by the Indian Agriculture sector. India is known to be the world’s largest producer of pulses, rice, wheat, spices and spice products. Farmer’s economic growth depends on the quality of the products that they produce, which relies on the plant’s growth and the yield they get. Therefore in the field of agriculture, detection of disease in plants plays an important role so that the crops in the fields stay healthy and the production could be better and healthier. This would also help our farmers to have a better ecology which would lead to an increase in the Indian Economy.

But every year there are cases where more than thousand tons of crops are wasted due to the diseases in plants and the loss becomes unbearable for the farmers. So, in order to help with the problem we need a system/architecture which could detect these diseases at the very initial stage. And this system should be made available to all with ease so that the farmers who are away from cities can also get their crop health without abandoning their farm in order to make the disease detection system advantageous. 

So, in order to detect the disease at the very initial stage with all the conditions satisfied we would need an automatic disease detection system. Since the symptoms of plant diseases are conspicuous in different parts of the plant such as leaves, figs, branches etc. So, manual detection of plant disease using images of these parts is a tedious job. Hence we require computational methods which will make the process of disease detection and classification using leaf images automatic.

So to tackle these problems and conditions the use of computer vision and deep learning concepts are proposed that could track the images of the plants in a better way when trained on better and structured data. For this we used CNNs where we used the images of plant leaves with different diseases including the images of healthy plant leaves. After attaining a good accuracy on the training dataset and testing the model the model could be deployed for commercial use.
